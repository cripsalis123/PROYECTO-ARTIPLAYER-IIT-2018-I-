                    <p class="think__details__info__title">Techniques to empathize</p>
			<p class="think__details__info__cont">We can do this in different ways:</p>
                        <p class="think__details__info__cont">-Observation: it is about observing the behaviors in the context in which they occur, without intervening in them and without reproducing them in laboratory conditions. The work is closer to that of an ethnographer who takes notes of what he sees in his notebooks. We must bear in mind that many times people respond to questionnaires or interviews depending on what they think is expected of them (in this case Dota 2 players), but frequently the practice reveals very different behaviors.
	                <p class="think__details__info__cont">-Participation: generate a conversation, prepare an interview from a script that allows you to obtain information complementary to pure observation. A key question in this regard is "Why?" Because it allows us to delve into the deepest motivations.
                        <p class="think__details__info__cont">-Observation and listening: it is a question of combining the two previous elements: observation and participation in the interested person's own context.

                <div class="think__details__info">
                    <p class="think__details__info__title">¿How can we get the information we need?</p>
	<p class="think__details__info__cont">There are several methods. For example, Jesús Gorriti, director of Fjord, points out the following ways in this conference given in the EOI:</p>	
		        <p class="think__details__info__cont">-Ethnography: from the observation a culture is described around a determined population. It's about seeing how someone does something in their own environment.
		        <p class="think__details__info__cont">-Interviews with experts (and with those interested in the game Dota 2 as the same players) thus obtaining information about their interests and getting a good idea.
			<p class="think__details__info__cont">-Focus groups: collect information necessary for an investigation, which consists of gathering a small group of 6 to 12 people in order to answer questions.
			<p class="think__details__info__cont">-Benchmarks: compare with what other sales sites that have the same theme of our product do, find advantages that could benefit us (in our case we would be the only ones offering this kind of products in the region).

                <div class="think__details__info">
                    <p class="think__details__info__title"Benchmarking</p>
        <p class="think__details__info__cont">It is the process by which information is collected and new ideas are obtained, by comparing aspects of your company with the leaders or the strongest competitors in the market.</p>	
        <p class="think__details__info__cont">According to the definition of David T. Kearns, General Director of Xerox Corporation "benchmarking is a systematic and continuous process to evaluate the products, services and work processes of organizations recognized as the best practices, those toughest competitors".</p>	
	<p class="think__details__info__cont">In summary, benchamarking consists of taking as reference the best and adapting their methods, their strategies, within the law. For example, you can adapt the best practices in customer service and attention.<p>
